# UFO Sightings Roadtrip
Our project aims to answer the question: What is the shortest path between the user selected starting point and a target UFO sighting, taking into account that the route passes through other UFO sightings. The user will be able to input a starting and target UFO sighting location and the program will output the path of different UFO sightings on the way to the target location on a map.
